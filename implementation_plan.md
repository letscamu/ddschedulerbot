### Architecture Notes

The scheduler uses a **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** approach with **pipeline-based flow**, which differs from the queue-based approach originally described. Key characteristics:

- Orders flow through a pipeline of operations
- Core lifecycle is tracked through: available → oven → in_use → cleaning → available
- 5 injection machines with rubber type tracking
- 5-tier priority: Hot ASAP → Hot Dated → Rework → Normal → CAVO

### Technology Stack (Actual Implementation)

> **Note:** The original plan described a React.js + Node.js/Express stack. The actual implementation uses:
> - **Backend:** Python 3.11 with Flask, Jinja2 templates
> - **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5, jQuery, DataTables (server-rendered HTML + client-side AJAX)
> - **Storage:** Google Cloud Storage (persistent file storage)
> - **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run (Docker container with gunicorn)
> - **Authentication:** Flask-Login with environment-variable-based user management

### Recent Additions

- **Web Application**: Full Flask web app with login, dashboard, file upload, schedule viewer, reports, and simulation pages
- **Google Cloud Run Deployment**: Live at https://www.estradabot.biz
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Persistent file storage for uploads, reports, and schedule state
- **Schedule Persistence**: Generated schedules saved to GCS and automatically restored on container startup, available to all users
- **Hot List Priority Scheduling**: Supports ASAP and dated entries with REDLINE rubber override
- **Rework Detection**: Identifies orders needing re-BLAST via REMOV RB work center
- **Impact Analysis**: Compares baseline schedule vs hot list schedule
- **Actual Start Date**: Pulls WO creation date from Pegging Report

## MVP 1.x Release Plan

Agreed Feb 15, 2026. Items moved from old MVP 2.0 plan, split into 3 focused releases.

### MVP 1.8 — Quick wins + reporting

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Role name normalization | Complete | Fix `customer_service` vs `customerservice` — tech debt cleanup before RBAC |
| Resource utilization report | Complete | Per-station/machine utilization Excel export with two sheets |
| Days Idle column | Complete | From Shop Dispatch "Elapsed Days"; 9999→0 rule, added to Master Schedule export |

### MVP 1.9 — Simulation power

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Extended simulation (6-day, skeleton shifts) | In progress | See design decisions below |

**MVP 1.9 Design Decisions (deglazed Feb 15, 2026):**
- Skeleton = takt time adjustment (all machines available, fewer staff = longer takt). User enters takt in minutes.
- Per-day config: Mon–Sat grid. Each day: working yes/no, full/skeleton, day/night/both shift selection.
- Add `6day_12h` as 4th standard preset scenario.
- Advanced Configuration panel in planner workflow → runs ONE custom config → produces ONE selectable scenario card.
- No multi-custom-config comparison (future enhancement).
- No quick-fill presets inside advanced panel (existing scenario cards serve as presets).
- CURE/QUENCH on skeleton days: treated as full working days for continuous ops; only takt and active shifts change.
- Validation: ≥1 working day, takt 1–120 min, every working day needs ≥1 shift, 10h base disables night-only skeleton.
- No config persistence (configure each time). No /api/generate update (planner-only). No simulation visualization changes.

## MVP 2.0 Planning

See `MVP_2.0_Planning.md` for full details. **Scope redefined Feb 15, 2026.** Key features:

### 3.1 Objectives
- Implement basic scheduling logic (FIFO)
- Handle resource constraints (machines, cores, capacity)
- Calculate operation start/end times
- Respect work schedule (shifts, holidays)

### 3.2 Detailed Steps

#### Step 2.1: Define Data Models
**Duration:** 1 day

**Models needed:**
```python
class WorkOrder:
    wo_number: str
    part_number: str
    description: str
    customer: str
    creation_date: datetime
    promise_date: datetime
    quantity: int = 1
    routing: List[Operation]
    assigned_core: str  # e.g., "124-B"
    
class Operation:
    name: str
    sap_number: str
    workcenter: str
    cycle_time: float  # hours
    setup_time: float
    machines_available: int
    concurrent_capacity: int
    scheduled_start: datetime
    scheduled_end: datetime
    
class Resource:
    resource_id: str  # e.g., "Autoclave_5"
    type: str  # e.g., "injection_machine"
    available: bool
    current_rubber: str  # For injection machines
    utilization: float
    schedule: List[Tuple[datetime, datetime, str]]  # (start, end, wo_number)
    
class Core:
    core_number: int
    suffix: str
    state: str  # available, oven, in_use, cleaning
    assigned_to: str  # wo_number
    state_change_time: datetime
```

#### Step 2.2: Work Schedule Calculator
**Duration:** 2 days

**Task 2.2.1: Shift Configuration**
- Accept user inputs: days/week, shift length, start times
- Generate working hours for date range
- Default: 2 shifts (5 AM - 3 PM, 5 PM - 3 AM), 5 days/week

**Task 2.2.2: Holiday Calendar**
- Load federal holidays for current year
- Allow user to add custom shutdown dates
- Function: `is_working_time(datetime) -> bool`

**Task 2.2.3: Time Advancement**
- Given current time and duration, calculate end time
- Skip non-working hours
- Account for shift boundaries
- Handle overnight operations

**Code Example:**
```python
def advance_time(start_time, duration_hours, work_schedule):
    """
    Advance time by duration_hours, skipping non-working periods.
    Returns end_time.
    """
    current = start_time
    remaining = duration_hours
    
    while remaining > 0:
        if not is_working_time(current, work_schedule):
            # Skip to next shift start
            current = next_shift_start(current, work_schedule)
            continue
        
        # How much time until shift ends?
        shift_end = get_shift_end(current, work_schedule)
        time_in_shift = (shift_end - current).total_seconds() / 3600
        
        if time_in_shift >= remaining:
            # Can finish in this shift
            current = current + timedelta(hours=remaining)
            remaining = 0
        else:
            # Use rest of shift, continue in next shift
            remaining -= time_in_shift
            current = next_shift_start(shift_end, work_schedule)
    
    return current
```

#### Step 2.3: Routing Generator
**Duration:** 2 days

**Task 2.3.1: Build Routing for Order**
- Determine if new or reline (based on part number prefix)
- Look up routing flags in Process Map
- Create sequence of operations
- Attach time parameters to each operation

**Task 2.3.2: Variable Time Lookup**
- For INJECTION, CURE, QUENCH: get times from Core Mapping
- Use part number to lookup
- Handle missing data (flag as error)

**Code Example:**
```python
def build_routing(order, process_map, core_mapping):
    """Generate list of operations for this order."""
    is_reline = order.part_number.startswith('XN')
    routing_row = 'Reline Stator' if is_reline else 'New Stator'
    
    operations = []
    for op_name, op_data in process_map.items():
        # Check if this operation applies to this product type
        if op_data['routing_flags'][routing_row] == 'Yes':
            operation = Operation(
                name=op_name,
                sap_number=op_data['sap_number'],
                workcenter=op_data['workcenter'],
                cycle_time=get_cycle_time(op_name, order, op_data, core_mapping),
                setup_time=op_data['setup_time'],
                machines_available=op_data['machines_available'],
                concurrent_capacity=op_data['concurrent_capacity']
            )
            operations.append(operation)
    
    return operations

def get_cycle_time(op_name, order, op_data, core_mapping):
    """Get cycle time, checking for variable times."""
    if op_name == 'INJECTION':
        return core_mapping[order.part_number]['injection_time']
    elif op_name == 'CURE':
        return core_mapping[order.part_number]['cure_time']
    elif op_name == 'QUENCH':
        return core_mapping[order.part_number]['quench_time']
    else:
        return op_data['cycle_time']
```

#### Step 2.4: Core Allocation Logic
**Duration:** 2 days

**Task 2.4.1: Core Assignment**
- When scheduling order, look up required core number
- Find available core with that number (check inventory)
- Assign specific core (with suffix) to order
- Track core state through lifecycle

**Task 2.4.2: Core State Machine**
```
available → oven (2.5 hrs) → ready → in_use (assembly → injection → cure → quench) 
→ disassembly → cleaning (45 min) → available
```

**Task 2.4.3: Core Availability Checker**
- Before scheduling order, check if core will be available
- If not, queue order or delay start
- Flag core shortages

**Code Example:**
```python
def assign_core(order, core_inventory, schedule_time):
    """
    Find and assign available core for this order.
    Returns (core_number, suffix) or None if unavailable.
    """
    required_core = get_required_core(order.part_number, core_mapping)
    
    if required_core not in core_inventory:
        raise CoreShortageError(f"Core {required_core} not in inventory")
    
    # Find available core with this number
    for core in core_inventory[required_core]:
        if core['state'] == 'available':
            # Mark as assigned
            core['state'] = 'oven'
            core['state_change_time'] = schedule_time
            core['assigned_to'] = order.wo_number
            return (required_core, core['suffix'])
    
    # No cores available
    return None
```

#### Step 2.5: Basic FIFO Scheduler
**Duration:** 3 days

**Task 2.5.1: Order Sorting**
- Sort orders by creation date (earliest first)
- This is base FIFO sequence

**Task 2.5.2: Sequential Scheduling**
- Start with first order in sorted list
- Schedule BLAST operation (first scheduled operation)
- For each subsequent operation:
  - Check resource availability
  - Wait for previous operation to complete
  - Wait for resource to become available
  - Schedule operation
  - Update resource schedule

**Task 2.5.3: Resource Tracking**
- Maintain schedule for each machine/resource
- When operation needs resource, find earliest available time
- Book resource for operation duration
- Handle concurrent operations (TUBE PREP + CORE OVEN)

**Code Example:**
```python
def schedule_orders_fifo(orders, resources, work_schedule, start_date):
    """
    Schedule orders in FIFO sequence.
    Returns scheduled_orders with operation times.
    """
    # Sort by creation date
    orders.sort(key=lambda o: o.creation_date)
    
    scheduled = []
    
    for order in orders:
        # Assign core
        core = assign_core(order, core_inventory, start_date)
        if core is None:
            # Log core shortage, skip or queue
            log_shortage(order)
            continue
        
        order.assigned_core = f"{core[0]}-{core[1]}"
        
        # Schedule each operation in routing
        prev_end_time = start_date
        
        for operation in order.routing:
            # Find resource
            resource = find_available_resource(
                operation.workcenter,
                prev_end_time,
                operation.cycle_time + operation.setup_time,
                resources,
                work_schedule
            )
            
            # Schedule operation
            op_start = max(prev_end_time, resource.next_available_time)
            op_end = advance_time(op_start, operation.cycle_time + operation.setup_time, work_schedule)
            
            operation.scheduled_start = op_start
            operation.scheduled_end = op_end
            
            # Book resource
            resource.schedule.append((op_start, op_end, order.wo_number))
            resource.next_available_time = op_end
            
            # Update for next operation
            prev_end_time = op_end
        
        # Final completion time
        order.completion_date = order.routing[-1].scheduled_end
        order.turnaround_time = (order.completion_date - order.creation_date).days
        
        scheduled.append(order)
    
    return scheduled
```

### 3.3 Phase 2 Testing

**Test Cases:**
1. Schedule 10 orders with simple routing (all new or all reline)
2. Verify operation times respect work schedule (no work on weekends)
3. Check resource allocation (no double-booking)
4. Verify concurrent operations (TUBE PREP + CORE OVEN) scheduled correctly
5. Core assignment works (unique cores assigned)
6. Turnaround time calculated correctly

**Deliverable:**
- Basic scheduler engine
- Generates feasible schedule with operation times
- Text-based output showing schedule

---

## 4. Phase 3: Optimization Logic (Weeks 6-7) ⚠️ MOSTLY COMPLETE

> **Status:**
> - ✅ Hot List Priority (ASAP and dated entries, REDLINE rubber override)
> - ✅ Rework Detection (REMOV RB work center detection)
> - ✅ 5-Tier Priority System
> - ✅ Impact Analysis
> - ❌ Rubber Grouping (changeover optimization not implemented)
> - ❌ Dual-Cylinder Mode (not implemented)

### 4.1 Objectives
- Implement rubber type sequencing optimization
- Add hot list priority handling
- Calculate and display schedule impacts
- Optimize for minimal turnaround time

### 4.2 Detailed Steps

#### Step 3.1: Rubber Type Grouping
**Duration:** 2 days

**Task 3.1.1: Rubber Type Analyzer**
- Analyze orders in queue by rubber type
- Count orders per type: HR, XE, XR, XD
- Identify low-volume types (XR, XD)
- Group consecutive orders of same type

**Task 3.1.2: Injection Machine Assignment**
- Assign orders to specific injection machines
- Try to group same rubber types on same machine
- Calculate changeover time penalty (1 hour) when switching
- Recommend dual-cylinder mode if beneficial

**Optimization Goal:**
- Minimize number of rubber changeovers
- Group XR and XD orders together
- Balance load across 5 machines

**Code Example:**
```python
def optimize_injection_sequence(orders):
    """
    Re-sequence orders to minimize rubber changeovers.
    Returns optimized sequence.
    """
    # Group by rubber type
    by_rubber = {}
    for order in orders:
        rubber = get_rubber_type(order.part_number, core_mapping)
        if rubber not in by_rubber:
            by_rubber[rubber] = []
        by_rubber[rubber].append(order)
    
    # Prioritize grouping low-volume types
    optimized_sequence = []
    
    # First, schedule grouped XR and XD
    for rare_rubber in ['XR', 'XD']:
        if rare_rubber in by_rubber:
            optimized_sequence.extend(by_rubber[rare_rubber])
    
    # Then interleave HR and XE to balance machines
    hr_orders = by_rubber.get('HR', [])
    xe_orders = by_rubber.get('XE', [])
    
    # Simple interleaving (can be more sophisticated)
    while hr_orders or xe_orders:
        if hr_orders:
            optimized_sequence.append(hr_orders.pop(0))
        if xe_orders:
            optimized_sequence.append(xe_orders.pop(0))
    
    return optimized_sequence
```

#### Step 3.2: Hot List Integration
**Duration:** 2 days

**Task 3.2.1: Hot List Parser**
- Read Excel file with WO# list
- Validate WO# exist in main order list
- Flag errors for invalid WO#

**Task 3.2.2: Priority Sequencing**
- Move hot list orders to front of queue
- Maintain FIFO within hot list
- Re-schedule all orders
- Calculate delay impact on non-hot orders

**Task 3.2.3: Impact Analysis**
- Compare original schedule vs hot list schedule
- For each delayed order, calculate:
  - Original completion date
  - New completion date
  - Days delayed
  - New turnaround time
  - Promise date impact (now late?)

**Code Example:**
```python
def apply_hot_list(orders, hot_list_wos):
    """
    Move hot list orders to front, calculate impact.
    Returns (new_sequence, impact_report).
    """
    hot_orders = []
    normal_orders = []
    
    for order in orders:
        if order.wo_number in hot_list_wos:
            hot_orders.append(order)
        else:
            normal_orders.append(order)
    
    # Hot list first (FIFO within hot list), then normal orders
    new_sequence = hot_orders + normal_orders
    
    # Re-schedule with new sequence
    original_schedule = {o.wo_number: o.completion_date for o in orders}
    new_schedule = schedule_orders(new_sequence, ...)
    
    # Calculate impact
    impact = []
    for order in new_schedule:
        if order.wo_number not in hot_list_wos:
            original_date = original_schedule[order.wo_number]
            new_date = order.completion_date
            delay_days = (new_date - original_date).days
            
            if delay_days > 0:
                impact.append({
                    'wo_number': order.wo_number,
                    'customer': order.customer,
                    'original_date': original_date,
                    'new_date': new_date,
                    'days_delayed': delay_days,
                    'new_turnaround': order.turnaround_time,
                    'promise_date': order.promise_date,
                    'now_late': new_date > order.promise_date
                })
    
    return new_schedule, impact
```

#### Step 3.3: Dual-Cylinder Mode Recommendation
**Duration:** 1 day

**Logic:**
- If queue has many mixed rubber types (e.g., 40% HR, 40% XE, 20% XR)
- AND changeover time penalty is high
- THEN recommend dual-cylinder for one or more machines

**Calculation:**
- Compare: (changeover_time × num_changeovers) vs (2.2 × injection_time × num_orders)
- If dual-cylinder saves time overall, recommend it

#### Step 3.4: Turnaround Time Minimization
**Duration:** 2 days

**Heuristic Optimization:**
- Prioritize reline orders (80% of volume)
- Within reline, schedule oldest orders first
- Consider "critical ratio": (promise_date - current_date) / remaining_time
- If critical ratio < 1.0, order is at risk → prioritize

**Code Example:**
```python
def optimize_for_turnaround(orders):
    """
    Optimize sequence to minimize average turnaround time.
    """
    # Separate reline vs new
    reline = [o for o in orders if o.part_number.startswith('XN')]
    new = [o for o in orders if not o.part_number.startswith('XN')]
    
    # Sort reline by creation date (FIFO = minimize turnaround for majority)
    reline.sort(key=lambda o: o.creation_date)
    
    # Sort new by creation date
    new.sort(key=lambda o: o.creation_date)
    
    # Reline first (priority), then new
    return reline + new
```

### 4.3 Phase 3 Testing

**Test Cases:**
1. Rubber grouping reduces changeovers by ≥30%
2. Hot list correctly moves orders to front
3. Impact analysis shows accurate delay calculations
4. Dual-cylinder recommendation appears when appropriate
5. Turnaround time optimization reduces average by ≥10%

**Deliverable:**
- Optimized scheduler with rubber sequencing
- Hot list functionality with impact analysis
- Recommendation engine for dual-cylinder mode

- Identify operation locations
- Define paths between operations

**Task 5.1.2: Create SVG Layout**
- Design visual blocks for each operation
- Size blocks proportional to capacity
- Draw connection lines between operations
- Add labels

**Code Example (SVG layout):**
```jsx
function FloorMap({ operations }) {
  // Define positions based on floor map
  const positions = {
    'SUPERMKT': { x: 100, y: 100 },
    'BLAST': { x: 200, y: 100 },
    'TUBE PREP': { x: 300, y: 80 },
    'CORE OVEN': { x: 300, y: 120 },
    'ASSEMBLY': { x: 400, y: 100 },
    'INJECTION': { x: 500, y: 100 },
    // ... etc
  };
  
  return (
    <svg width="1200" height="600">
      {/* Draw operations */}
      {Object.entries(positions).map(([opName, pos]) => (
        <g key={opName}>
          <rect 
            x={pos.x} 
            y={pos.y} 
            width={80} 
            height={60}
            fill={getOperationColor(opName)}
            stroke="black"
          />
          <text x={pos.x + 40} y={pos.y + 35} textAnchor="middle">
            {opName}
          </text>
        </g>
      ))}
      
      {/* Draw connection lines */}
      <line x1={180} y1={130} x2={200} y2={130} stroke="gray" />
      {/* ... more lines */}
    </svg>
  );
}
```

#### Step 5.2: Machine Status Display
**Duration:** 1 day

**Color Coding:**
- Gray: Idle
- Yellow: < 40% utilization
- Green: 40-85% utilization
- Orange: > 85% utilization

**Utilization Calculation:**
```javascript
function calculateUtilization(resource, currentTime, windowHours = 8) {
  const windowStart = currentTime - (windowHours * 3600 * 1000);
  
  const scheduledTasks = resource.schedule.filter(task => 
    task.start >= windowStart && task.start <= currentTime
  );
  
  const totalScheduledTime = scheduledTasks.reduce((sum, task) => 
    sum + (task.end - task.start), 0
  );
  
  const windowDuration = windowHours * 3600 * 1000;
  const utilization = totalScheduledTime / windowDuration;
  
  return utilization;
}

function getUtilizationColor(utilization) {
  if (utilization === 0) return '#808080'; // Gray
  if (utilization < 0.40) return '#FFD700'; // Yellow
  if (utilization <= 0.85) return '#00AA00'; // Green
  return '#FF8C00'; // Orange
}
```

#### Step 5.3: Stator Animation
**Duration:** 3 days

**Task 5.3.1: Stator Objects**
- Create visual representation of stator (circle or icon)
- Track position and state
- Animate movement between operations

**Task 5.3.2: Movement Logic**
- Calculate path from operation A to operation B
- Animate along path (smooth transition)
- Duration based on simulation speed

**Code Example (React + D3):**
```jsx
function StatorAnimation({ stator, positions, speed }) {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState(positions[stator.currentOp]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const targetPos = positions[stator.nextOp];
    
    // D3 transition
    d3.select(`#stator-${stator.id}`)
      .transition()
      .duration(1000 / speed) // Adjust by speed
      .attr('cx', targetPos.x)
      .attr('cy', targetPos.y)
      .on('end', () => {
        setPosition(targetPos);
        stator.currentOp = stator.nextOp;
      });
  }, [stator.nextOp]);
  
  return (
    <circle
      id={`stator-${stator.id}`}
      cx={position.x}
      cy={position.y}
      r={5}
      fill="blue"
    />
  );
}
```

#### Step 5.4: Queue Display
**Duration:** 2 days

**Visualization:**
- Show waiting stators as stacked circles/icons near operation
- Display queue count as number
- Highlight SWIP threshold

**Code Example:**
```jsx
function QueueDisplay({ operation, queue, positions }) {
  const opPos = positions[operation.name];
  
  return (
    <g>
      {/* Queue items */}
      {queue.slice(0, 5).map((stator, i) => (
        <circle
          key={stator.id}
          cx={opPos.x - 20}
          cy={opPos.y + (i * 8)}
          r={3}
          fill="lightblue"
        />
      ))}
      
      {/* Queue count */}
      <text x={opPos.x - 20} y={opPos.y - 10}>
        Queue: {queue.length}
      </text>
      
      {/* SWIP indicator */}
      {operation.swip > 0 && (
        <text x={opPos.x - 20} y={opPos.y - 20} fill="red">
          SWIP: {operation.swip}
        </text>
      )}
    </g>
  );
}
```

#### Step 5.5: Simulation Engine
**Duration:** 3 days

**Event-Driven Simulation:**
- Process events in chronological order
- Events: operation start, operation end, resource available, stator move
- Advance simulation time event by event
- Update UI at each frame (60 FPS)

**Code Example:**
```javascript
class SimulationEngine {
  constructor(schedule, speed = 1) {
    this.events = this.generateEvents(schedule);
    this.currentTime = schedule.startDate;
    this.speed = speed; // 1200x = 20 min/sec
    this.isRunning = false;
    this.stators = [];
    this.resources = [];
  }
  
  generateEvents(schedule) {
    const events = [];
    
    for (const order of schedule.orders) {
      for (const operation of order.routing) {
        events.push({
          time: operation.scheduled_start,
          type: 'operation_start',
          order: order,
          operation: operation
        });
        
        events.push({
          time: operation.scheduled_end,
          type: 'operation_end',
          order: order,
          operation: operation
        });
      }
    }
    
    // Sort events by time
    events.sort((a, b) => a.time - b.time);
    return events;
  }
  
  start() {
    this.isRunning = true;
    this.animationLoop();
  }
  
  pause() {
    this.isRunning = false;
  }
  
  animationLoop() {
    if (!this.isRunning) return;
    
    // Process events up to current time
    while (this.events.length > 0 && this.events[0].time <= this.currentTime) {
      const event = this.events.shift();
      this.processEvent(event);
    }
    
    // Update UI
    this.updateVisualization();
    
    // Advance time (20 real minutes = 1 second)
    const msPerSimSecond = (20 * 60 * 1000) / this.speed;
    this.currentTime = new Date(this.currentTime.getTime() + msPerSimSecond / 60);
    
    // Continue loop
    requestAnimationFrame(() => this.animationLoop());
  }
  
  processEvent(event) {
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'operation_start':
        this.startOperation(event.order, event.operation);
        break;
      case 'operation_end':
        this.endOperation(event.order, event.operation);
        break;
    }
  }
  
  startOperation(order, operation) {
    // Find stator
    const stator = this.stators.find(s => s.orderId === order.wo_number);
    
    // Move to operation
    stator.currentOp = operation.name;
    stator.state = 'processing';
    
    // Mark resource busy
    const resource = this.resources.find(r => r.name === operation.workcenter);
    resource.busy = true;
  }
  
  endOperation(order, operation) {
    // Find stator
    const stator = this.stators.find(s => s.orderId === order.wo_number);
    
    // Move to next operation or complete
    const nextOp = this.getNextOperation(order, operation);
    if (nextOp) {
      stator.nextOp = nextOp.name;
      stator.state = 'moving';
    } else {
      stator.state = 'complete';
    }
    
    // Free resource
    const resource = this.resources.find(r => r.name === operation.workcenter);
    resource.busy = false;
  }
}
```

#### Step 5.6: Simulation Controls
**Duration:** 1 day

**Controls UI:**
- Play / Pause button
- Speed slider (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- Jump to date/time
- Highlight specific order (search by WO#)
- Time display (current simulated date/time)

**Code Example:**
```jsx
function SimulationControls({ simulation, onSpeedChange, onJumpToDate }) {
  return (
    <div className="simulation-controls">
      <button onClick={() => simulation.isRunning ? simulation.pause() : simulation.start()}>
        {simulation.isRunning ? 'Pause' : 'Play'}
      </button>
      
      <label>
        Speed:
        <input 
          type="range" 
          min="0.5" 
          max="10" 
          step="0.5"
          value={simulation.speed}
          onChange={e => onSpeedChange(parseFloat(e.target.value))}
        />
        <span>{simulation.speed}x</span>
      </label>
      
      <label>
        Jump to:
        <input 
          type="datetime-local" 
          onChange={e => onJumpToDate(new Date(e.target.value))}
        />
      </label>
      
      <div className="time-display">
        Current Time: {simulation.currentTime.toLocaleString()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Phase 8: MVP 1.1 — User Feedback Incorporation 🆕

> **Status:** PLANNED
> **Source:** Initial user feedback collected February 4, 2026 from Planning Team, Customer Service Team, and Product Owner
> **Target Version:** MVP 1.1
> **Related Documents:**
> - `planning_algorithm_logic.md` — Algorithm rules and flagged items
> - `data_fields_reference.md` — All data fields used from uploaded reports
> - `MVP_2.0_Planning.md` — Future requirements and clarifying questions

---

### 8.1 HIGH PRIORITY — Immediate Implementation

These items should be completed ASAP before continuing with other original implementation plan items.

---

#### 8.1.1 Fix First BLAST Time (Planning Team Feedback)

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Small | **Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Requirement:** The first blast time on each shift should be 5:30 AM (day shift) and 5:30 PM (night shift), not 5:20.

**Current Behavior:** 20-minute handover period (5:00-5:20 day, 17:00-17:20 night) → first blast at 5:20/17:20.

**Change Required:**
- In `backend/algorithms/des_scheduler.py`, `WorkScheduleConfig`:
  - Change `handover_minutes` from 20 to 30
  - Day shift handover: 5:00 AM - 5:30 AM (first blast at 5:30)
  - Night shift handover: 5:00 PM - 5:30 PM (first blast at 17:30)

**Files Affected:**
- `backend/algorithms/des_scheduler.py` — `WorkScheduleConfig` class, handover period definition

**Testing:**
- Verify first BLAST time in generated schedule is 5:30 AM
- Verify night shift first BLAST is 5:30 PM
- Verify break schedule is unaffected
- Verify total shift capacity calculation still correct

---

#### 8.1.2 Rubber Type Alternation in BLAST Sequence (Planning Team Feedback)

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium | **Status:** ❌ Not Started
**⚠️ FLAGGED RULE — See `planning_algorithm_logic.md` for rationale**

**Requirement:** When possible, alternate between XE and HR rubber types in the BLAST sequence. Do NOT schedule the same rubber type back-to-back unless no alternatives are available.

**Clarified Behavior:**
- The BLAST arrival sequence should alternate: XE → HR → XE → HR (when possible)
- Individual Desma machines remain dedicated to their rubber type (Desma 1-2 = HR, Desma 3-4 = XE)
- XD and XR rubber types should be planned on Desma 5 (flex machine)
- XD and XR orders should be grouped on the same day but spaced out with HR or XE orders between them
- This rule is FLAGGED: it may not ultimately matter and could be detrimental. Implementing to encourage user uptake. Subject to future review.

**Change Required:**
- Modify `_schedule_blast_arrivals()` in `des_scheduler.py`:
  - After priority sorting, when selecting the next order for a takt slot, prefer an order with a different rubber type than the previous order
  - Within the same priority tier, select alternating rubber types
  - Never break priority ordering (Hot-ASAP always first, etc.) — alternation is a tiebreaker within the same priority tier
  - For XD/XR orders: prefer scheduling them on the same day, interleaved with HR/XE

**Files Affected:**
- `backend/algorithms/des_scheduler.py` — `_schedule_blast_arrivals()` method
- `planning_algorithm_logic.md` — Document this rule with flag

**Testing:**
- Verify BLAST sequence alternates XE/HR when both are available
- Verify priority ordering is never violated
- Verify XD/XR orders land on Desma 5
- Verify XD/XR orders cluster on same day with spacing
- Test with all-HR or all-XE order sets (should not error)

---

#### 8.1.3 Eliminate Pegging Report (Planning Team Feedback)

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium | **Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Requirement:** Remove the Pegging Report from the process entirely. Remove it as a required upload, remove the "Actual Start Date" field, and any derived fields.

**Impact Analysis:**

| Impact Area | Current Behavior | After Change |
|---|---|---|
| Upload page | Pegging Report listed as optional upload | Remove from upload page entirely |
| Data loader | `PeggingParser` loads actual_start_date | Skip pegging report loading |
| Turnaround (new stators) | Uses `actual_start_date` from pegging | Falls back to `creation_date` (same as relines) |
| Turnaround (relines) | Uses `creation_date` | No change |
| Master Schedule report | "Actual Start Date" column displayed | Remove column |
| Schedule JSON API | `actual_start_date` field in response | Remove field |
| ScheduledOrder dataclass | Has `actual_start_date` attribute | Remove attribute |
| DES Scheduler | Uses `actual_start_date` for new stator turnaround calc | Use `creation_date` for all orders |

**Files Affected:**
- `backend/templates/upload.html` — Remove Pegging Report row from file types table and current files display
- `backend/data_loader.py` — Remove pegging report loading step, remove `actual_start_dates` merge logic
- `backend/parsers/pegging_parser.py` — File can be deleted or deprecated
- `backend/algorithms/des_scheduler.py` — Remove `actual_start_date` references in `_collect_results()`
- `backend/algorithms/scheduler.py` — Remove `actual_start_date` from `ScheduledOrder` dataclass
- `backend/app.py` — Remove `actual_start_date` from schedule JSON serialization, remove pegging from file category detection
- `backend/exporters/excel_exporter.py` — Remove "Actual Start Date" column from Master Schedule report
- `backend/templates/index.html` — Remove any pegging report file status references

**Testing:**
- Verify upload page no longer shows Pegging Report
- Verify schedule generates successfully without pegging file
- Verify turnaround calculation uses creation_date for all orders
- Verify Master Schedule report has no Actual Start Date column
- Verify no errors when pegging file is absent

---

#### 8.1.4 Schedule Page Column Filtering (Customer Service Feedback)

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium | **Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Requirement:** Add per-column filtering capability to the schedule page, alongside the existing sorting and global search box. Leave the current search box functionality as-is.

**Change Required:**
- Add a filter row below the header row in the DataTable
- Each column gets a filter input:
  - Text columns (WO#, Part Number, Customer, Core): text input search
  - Categorical columns (Rubber, Priority, Status): dropdown select filter
  - Date columns (BLAST Date, Completion, Promise Date): text input (filter by date string)
  - Numeric columns (Turnaround): text input with numeric filtering
- Filters work in combination (AND logic)
- Existing global search box remains unchanged

**Files Affected:**
- `backend/templates/schedule.html` — Add filter row HTML, add DataTables column filter initialization JS

**Testing:**
- Verify each column can be independently filtered
- Verify filters work together (AND logic)
- Verify global search still works alongside column filters
- Verify sorting still works on all columns
- Verify Excel export respects active filters

---

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Small | **Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Requirement:** Add "Serial Number" column (from Open Sales Order report) to the schedule page, Master Schedule report, and Impact Analysis report.

**Current State:** `serial_number` is already parsed by `sales_order_parser.py` but not passed through to the schedule output or displayed.

**Change Required:**
- Pass `serial_number` through the data pipeline: orders dict → DES scheduler → ScheduledOrder → JSON API → DataTable
- Add column to schedule page DataTable (position: after WO#)
- Add column to Master Schedule Excel report
- Add column to Impact Analysis "Delayed Orders" sheet

**Files Affected:**
- `backend/algorithms/scheduler.py` — Add `serial_number` field to `ScheduledOrder`

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Small | **Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Requirement:** Scrub "Unit Price" and "Customer Address" columns from any uploaded Open Sales Order reports upon upload, before storage in GCS. These columns should never be stored.

**Change Required:**
- In the `/api/upload` endpoint in `app.py`:
  - After receiving an Open Sales Order file, before uploading to GCS:
    - Open the Excel file with openpyxl
    - Remove "Unit Price" and "Customer Address" columns (and any similar column names like "Net Price", "Address")
    - Save the modified file
    - Upload the scrubbed version to GCS

#### 8.1.9 Schedule Mode Toggle — 4 vs 5 Day Work Week (Product Owner Feedback)

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Large | **Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Requirement:** Add an interface between the summary stats and the schedule table allowing users to switch between 4-day and 5-day work week schedules. Both schedules should be pre-generated when the user clicks "Generate."

**Change Required:**

*Backend:*
- Modify `/api/generate` to run the scheduler twice: once with 4-day week, once with 5-day week
- Store both schedule results in GCS state (keyed by mode: `schedule_4day`, `schedule_5day`)
- Modify `/api/schedule` to accept a `?mode=4day` or `?mode=5day` query parameter
- Generate reports for both modes (or for the published mode only)

*Frontend:*
- Add a toggle/button group between the stats cards and the schedule table on `schedule.html`
- Two options: "4-Day Week (Mon-Thu)" and "5-Day Week (Mon-Fri)"
- Toggling fetches the alternate schedule data and refreshes the table and stats
- Visually indicate which mode is currently displayed
- Default to 4-day (current behavior)

*Scheduler:*
- Make `WorkScheduleConfig.work_days` configurable (currently hardcoded to `[0,1,2,3]`)
- Accept a `work_days` parameter: 4-day = `[0,1,2,3]`, 5-day = `[0,1,2,3,4]`

**Files Affected:**
- `backend/algorithms/des_scheduler.py` — Parameterize `work_days` in `WorkScheduleConfig`
- `backend/app.py` — Dual schedule generation, mode-aware API endpoints

---

#### 8.1.10 Published Schedule Concept (Product Owner Feedback)

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium | **Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Requirement:** Only the schedule generated from the planner's uploaded data should be saved as the "Published Schedule." Restrict schedule generation to Planner and Admin roles only.

**Change Required:**
- Add role checking to `/api/generate` endpoint — only `admin` and planner roles can generate
- The generated schedule becomes the "Published Schedule" visible to all users
- Hide the "Generate Schedule" button/link for non-planner/admin users
- Add visual indicator on schedule page: "Published Schedule — Generated by [user] on [date]"
- Customer Service and Guest roles can only view the published schedule

**Files Affected:**
